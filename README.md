# LINE Token

Borrow LINE tokens for GBYTE collateral. Repay the loan + interest at any time.

The price of LINE tokens can grow or fall. If it falls, the borrower can always repay the loan and get the original collateral back, thus ensuring that their wealth doesn't fall below some line (determined by interest and fees).

## Liquidity provider incentives

There are rewards (paid in LINE tokens) for providing liquidity to selected AMM pools. These pools help to ensure liquidity in LINE markets.

## KAVA rewards

One can bridge LINE tokens to Obyte, lock them on a rewards AA and get a share of KAVA rewards in proportion to the locked balance.
